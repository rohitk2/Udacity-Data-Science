                            My name is Rohit Kumar. I am a fifth year student at UIUC 
                            studying computer engineering and statistics. Some of my 
                            hobbies include reading books, watching comedy on netflix 
                            or youtube clips, watching prison channels, lifting, and 
                            being outdoors. I was born and brought up in San Jose, CA. 
                            I attended elementary and midddle school at Challenger. 
                            Challenger was crazy in the fact that it was so small and tiny.
                            My horizon of the world was almost nothing. My eight grade graduating class had 12 people.
                            Then I went to Archbishop Mitty High School, where I felt 
                            extremely out of place. It was a catholic private highschool with 1600+ students.
                            Compared to many high schools, it was small but for me it was huge.
                            I was an awkward kid, mediocre at school (our school was a powerhouse so mediocre was still well-above average).
                            After 4 years of highschool I left and went to the midwest for 5 years to 
                            study at one of the top computer engineering colleges, UIUC. 
                            This website is about my experiences at UIUC.

                            My motivation to do this project is to gain some front-end experience
                            I want to some day have the skills to succeed in data science and in order to
                            do that I need some full-stacks web development skills and some project experience.
                            I do not need to be an expert but just enough to understand and work with UI/UX. I might
                            need it because I might be working with the backend DJango, Flask, etc. Having experience 
                            with front-end will only add to my resume and give me a good idea of the entire process.
                            As a data science and machine learning guy, I do feel like it is important to know full
                            stack web development, escpecially because that is the best way to get your project out there 
                            and is used in the industry.
