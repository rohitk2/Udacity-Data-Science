# University Data Exploration

## Project Motivation
I wanted to improve my skills in data manipulation and just my overall ability to wrangle data using pandas. I also wanted to add a matplotlib graph. Some of the questions I answered were about trends in racial diversity, gender breakup and graduation rates from the data.

## File Description
I used a csv called 'University_Admission.csv' that I found on kaggle. Here is the link to it: https://www.kaggle.com/samsonqian/college-admissions
I also made a jupyter notebook called 'University_Admission.ipynb' where I did all of my analysis.

## Libraries Used
Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib and sklearn

## Results of the analysis
(1) Which colleges have an abnormal amount of women and minorities?
(2) What are some colleges with a lot of racial diversity?
(3) What factors correlated (positively and negatively) with racial diversity?
(4) What factors correlated (positively and negatively) with graduation rates?
