## University Data Exploration

In my first project, I imported a dataset from kaggle about university admission statistics. I used panda and matplotlib to analyze and visualize some of the trends. I will provide more information in the notebook and in the repository itself.



## NBA Fantasy

In my second project, I created a fantasy team class. You are allowed to add as many players as you want. You can see their statistics as soon as you add them. Whenever you try to add a player, it will check whether the player exists and is active. If either of those conditions are not met, then you cannot add the player. The default season is set to 2019-20, but you can change the season. Whenever you add a player, it pulls the data from NBA.com using the API: https://github.com/swar/nba_api/tree/master/nba_api. More information is provided in the notebook. Some of the libraries you should have installed before running the notebook are <bold> nba_api, numpy and panda </bold>
