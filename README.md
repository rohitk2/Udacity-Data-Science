## University Data Exploration

My first project, I imported a dataset from kaggle about university admission statistics. I used panda and matplotlib to analyze and visualize some of the trends. I will provide more information in the notebook and in the repository: https://github.com/rohitk2/Udacity-Data-Science/tree/main/University%20Data%20Exploration
